  stage1_survey: `You are a senior software architect performing a codebase audit.
Your task is to categorize this project based on the analysis data provided.

Respond with a JSON object containing:
- projectCategory: One of ["web-frontend", "web-backend", "api-service", "cli-tool", "library", "mobile-app", "desktop-app", "data-pipeline", "ml-service", "monorepo", "other"]
- primaryLanguage: The main language
- frameworks: Array of detected frameworks
- architecturePattern: One of ["layered", "hexagonal", "microservices", "monolith", "serverless", "event-driven", "mvc", "other"]
- domainSummary: One sentence describing what this system does
- suggestedDomains: Array of domain names for OpenSpec specs (e.g., ["user", "order", "auth", "api"])
- confidence: 0-1 score of how confident you are
- schemaFiles: Array of file paths (from the provided file list) that define data models, types, entities, or interfaces — these will be used for entity extraction. Include files regardless of their name, based on their content role.
- serviceFiles: Array of file paths containing business logic, services, processors, analyzers, pipelines, or domain operations — used for service analysis. Do not filter by name conventions; look at what the file does.
- apiFiles: Array of file paths that expose public interfaces: HTTP routes, CLI command handlers, GraphQL resolvers, message consumers, or external-facing APIs.

For schemaFiles/serviceFiles/apiFiles: use the exact file paths from the provided analysis. Return [] if none apply.

Example output:
{
  "projectCategory": "api-service",
  "primaryLanguage": "TypeScript",
  "frameworks": ["Express", "Prisma"],
  "architecturePattern": "layered",
  "domainSummary": "REST API managing e-commerce orders and inventory.",

  stage2_entities: (projectCategory: string, frameworks: string[]) => `You are analyzing the core data models of a ${projectCategory} built with ${frameworks.join(', ')}.

For each entity you identify, extract in OpenSpec format:
- name: The entity name (e.g., "User", "Order")
- description: What this entity represents in the business domain
- properties: Array of {name, type, description, required}
- relationships: Array of {targetEntity, type, description}
- validations: Array of validation rules as strings (these become Requirements)
- scenarios: Array of {name, given, when, then, and?} - observable behaviors in Given/When/Then format

Focus on BUSINESS entities, not framework internals.
Be precise - only include what you can verify from the code.

Example output:
[{
  "name": "Order",
  "description": "Represents a customer purchase transaction.",
  "properties": [
    {"name": "id", "type": "string", "description": "Unique identifier", "required": true},

  stage3_services: (projectCategory: string, entities: string[], suggestedDomains: string[]) => `You are analyzing the logic and processing layer of a ${projectCategory}.

Known entities: ${entities.join(', ')}
Available domains: ${suggestedDomains.join(', ')}

For each service/module, identify:
- name: Service name
- purpose: What capability or responsibility it encapsulates
- operations: Array of {name, description, inputs, outputs, scenarios, functionName} - key operations/methods that become Requirements with Scenarios. Cover all meaningful operations that represent distinct business behaviors.
  - operations[].functionName: The exact function or method name as written in the source code that implements this operation (e.g. "runStage2", "buildSpecMap"). Leave empty string if uncertain.
- dependencies: Array of other services/repositories it uses
- sideEffects: Array of external interactions (file I/O, network calls, database, queues, etc.)
- domain: Which domain OWNS this service (where it lives in the codebase, not who uses it) — use ONLY one of the available domains listed above

Focus on WHAT the service does, not HOW it's implemented.
Express operations as requirements (SHALL/MUST/SHOULD) with testable scenarios.

Example output:
[{
  "name": "OrderService",
  "purpose": "Manages order lifecycle: placement, validation, and fulfillment.",
  "operations": [

- requestSchema: Expected input as JSON object
- responseSchema: Expected output as JSON object
- scenarios: Array of {name, given, when, then, and?} - example request/response flows
