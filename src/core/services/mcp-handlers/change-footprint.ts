/**
 * Change footprint projection + pairwise hazard classification
 * (change: add-change-footprint-projection, the foundation of
 * PARALLEL-WORK-COORDINATION).
 *
 * Generalizes `blast_radius` from "one symbol" to "a declared task": given a
 * caller-supplied {@link TaskDescriptor}, compute a deterministic three-region
 * {@link Footprint} (write / read / affected) plus a soft co-change annotation,
 * and a pure {@link classifyHazard} over two footprints returning the strongest
 * data-hazard between them (WAW / shared-append / RAW / WAR / soft-coupling /
 * none).
 *
 * Design invariants (mirrors the proposal's Decision + Scope contract):
 * - **Borrow-checker, not a lock.** Everything here is a pure function of the
 *   graph state, the change-coupling store, and the descriptor — no persistence,
 *   no clock, no new MCP tool, no graph-schema change. The consumer
 *   (`plan_parallel_work`, proposal 2) holds any state.
 * - **Declared, not inferred.** The write-set is the caller's declared seeds,
 *   normalized to enclosing scope — never a prediction of the edits an agent
 *   will make. It is reported as advisory with a known-unknowable disclosure.
 * - **Reuse, don't reinvent.** The affected-set is the existing backward
 *   reachability (`bfs` over the same adjacency `analyze_impact`/`blast_radius`
 *   use); the read-set is the existing call-distance-scoped forward closure
 *   (`weightedBfs`); coupling-neighbors come from the existing change-coupling
 *   store thresholds. No new traversal semantics.
 * - **Honesty over coverage.** An unresolved seed yields an empty footprint with
 *   an explicit note, never a fabricated region. Ambient (ubiquitous) symbols
 *   are excluded from the read-set and from generating RAW edges, but a
 *   deliberate *write* of an ambient symbol still creates a hazard.
