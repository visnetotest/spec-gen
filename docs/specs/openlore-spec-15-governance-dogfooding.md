## Progress

Branch: `openlore-spec-15-governance-dogfooding`. Not started.

- [ ] Activate the decisions pre-commit gate in OpenLore's own repo
- [ ] Retroactively record the genuinely-architectural decisions already made
- [ ] Consolidate, then sync into `openspec/specs/`
- [ ] Verify the gate blocks/passes correctly on a test commit
- [ ] Document the dogfood result

---

## Context for you (the agent)

The decision store and spec-drift gate are OpenLore's genuinely differentiated asset — no code
navigation tool in the field pairs a code graph with recorded architectural decisions and a
drift gate. The full workflow exists in code:
[src/core/decisions/](../../src/core/decisions/) (`extractor`, `consolidator`, `store`,
`syncer`, `verifier`) plus the gate documented in [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md).

But it is not exercised in this repository — `.openlore/decisions/` is empty and the gate is not
active here. An unused differentiator reads as "a feature even the authors do not run." Spec 16
(promoting decisions to graph nodes) also depends on there being real decisions to project.
This spec turns the system on, on ourselves, and produces the evidence.

In the Spec 13 layering this is the **why-layer (Layer 2)**, and it is what the architecture-
invariant instrument (Spec 23) consults at edit time. Dogfooding here is what makes that
downstream analysis credible rather than theoretical.

## Scope contract — do not break these things

This PR must NOT:

- Change the decision data model or file format in ways that invalidate existing stores.
- Make the gate mandatory for downstream users — it stays opt-in, exactly as today.
- Add LLM cost to commits beyond what the gate already documents.

This PR must:

- Activate the pre-commit decisions gate in this repo's hook config.
- Record the real architectural decisions already embedded in the codebase via the existing
  `record_decision` path — for example: SCIP as one-way export only
  ([src/cli/export/scip.ts:6](../../src/cli/export/scip.ts#L6)); IaC resources projecting onto
  the existing graph primitives ([iac/project.ts](../../src/core/analyzer/iac/project.ts)); the
  edge-store `SCHEMA_VERSION` rebuild-on-bump strategy
  ([edge-store.ts](../../src/core/services/edge-store.ts)); BM25-without-embeddings as the
  zero-network retrieval floor (Spec 06).
- Run consolidation and sync the results into `openspec/specs/`.
- Verify the gate behaves correctly (blocks when decisions are pending/unsynced, passes when
  clean), then document what was recorded and synced.

## The deliverable

- A non-empty, consolidated decision store in `.openlore/decisions/`.
- Synced decision sections in the relevant `openspec/specs/` domains.
- The gate wired into this repo's hooks, with a short `docs/` note describing the dogfood run
  and the decision IDs/domains produced.

## Implementation approach (where it lives)

- **Install the idempotent pre-commit hook** (template + marker `# openlore-decisions-hook` in
  [decisions.ts](../../src/cli/commands/decisions.ts)) via `openlore decisions --install-hook`.
  Today this repo has only `pre-commit.sample` and no `.openlore/decisions/` — a clean slate.
- **Record the real architectural decisions already embedded in the code** via `record_decision`:
  SCIP as one-way export; IaC projecting onto the shared graph primitives; the edge-store
  `SCHEMA_VERSION` rebuild-on-bump strategy; BM25-without-embeddings as the zero-network floor;
  and the analysis-layer direction itself (Spec 13).
- **Run the full workflow** — consolidate → verify → approve → sync into `openspec/specs/` (and
  ADR files under `openspec/decisions/` for cross-domain/system scope).

## Compatibility verification (grounded 2026-05-30)

- Affects **only this repo's configuration and its self-authored specs/decisions** — zero change
  to the shipped product's behavior for users.
- The hook is **idempotent** (marker-guarded) and **skippable** (`git commit --no-verify`); the
  decision store schema (`version: '1'`) is unchanged.

## Acceptance

- `openlore decisions` lists real, consolidated decisions for this repo.
- The corresponding spec domains contain synced decision content.
- A deliberate test commit demonstrates the gate blocking and then passing after sync.

## Compatibility note

Affects only OpenLore's own repository configuration and its self-authored specs/decisions.
Zero change to the shipped product's behavior for users.
