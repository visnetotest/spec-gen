# Homebrew formula for openlore.
#
# openlore is published to npm (https://www.npmjs.com/package/openlore); this
# formula installs that published tarball under a Homebrew-managed Node prefix,
# so `brew install` users get the same bits as `npm i -g openlore`.
#
# Status: staged for a future homebrew-core submission (not a personal tap). When
# the project clears Homebrew's notability bar, this file is the ready artifact to
# open against homebrew/homebrew-core, giving a plain `brew install openlore` with
# no tap. Until then the supported install is npm. Refresh `url`/`sha256` for the
# current release with `npm run homebrew:formula`. See packaging/homebrew/README.md.
