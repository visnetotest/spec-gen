# Project Antipatterns

Failure patterns discovered post-merge. Automatically checked by agents during
brainstorm and implementation via `spec-gen-brainstorm` and `spec-gen-implement-story`.

To add an entry: run `/spec-gen-debug` — Step 9 evaluates whether the bug
qualifies as a cross-cutting antipattern and appends here if so.
