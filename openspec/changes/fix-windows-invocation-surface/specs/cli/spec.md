## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: WindowsInvocationResolvesOrDiscloses

Every command the CLI executes on the user's behalf, and every launch command it writes into a
generated agent config (MCP server entries, hooks, slash commands), SHALL be resolvable on the
platform where it will run: on Windows, package-manager and `npx` invocations SHALL be emitted or
spawned in a form the platform can execute (`.cmd` resolution or an equivalent wrapper), through
one shared platform-resolution helper rather than per-site fixes. The project SHALL additionally
state its platform support explicitly: either Windows is exercised by CI, or the documentation
declares its support tier and `doctor` discloses it at runtime — a platform is never
implied-working while known-broken.

#### Scenario: `openlore update` executes its upgrade on Windows

- **GIVEN** a Windows machine where the install method resolves to a runnable upgrade command
- **WHEN** `openlore update` runs the upgrade
- **THEN** the spawn resolves the platform's executable form of `npm` and runs it, instead of
  failing ENOENT and reporting exit code 127

#### Scenario: A generated config launches on the platform that generated it

- **GIVEN** `openlore install` run on Windows wiring an MCP client that spawns the server directly
- **WHEN** the client starts the configured command
- **THEN** the written command is executable on win32 (not a bare `npx` the client cannot
  resolve), and configs generated on macOS/Linux are unchanged

#### Scenario: Support is stated, not implied

- **GIVEN** a user evaluating OpenLore on Windows
- **WHEN** they consult the README or run `openlore doctor`
- **THEN** they find either CI-backed Windows support or an explicit best-effort tier statement —
  never silence that implies parity
