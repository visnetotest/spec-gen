# analyzer spec delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: VectorIndexCacheCoherence

The vector index's process-lifetime caches (meta sidecar, BM25 corpus, LanceDB table handle) SHALL
be invalidated when the on-disk index has changed since the cache entry was populated, regardless
of which process performed the rebuild. Coherence SHALL be established structurally — by comparing
the meta sidecar's on-disk state (mtime / `builtAt` stamp) against the state captured at cache
population — not by a time-based expiry, and the watcher SHALL additionally clear the caches when
a background rebuild it spawned completes. A remediation the system prints (such as "run
`openlore analyze --force`") SHALL take effect in the live serving process once performed.

#### Scenario: Out-of-process rebuild is picked up without restart

- **GIVEN** a live MCP server with warm vector-index caches
- **WHEN** a detached `analyze --force` child (or any other process) overwrites the LanceDB table
  and meta sidecar
- **THEN** the next search invalidates the stale per-dbPath caches and serves the rebuilt dataset,
  routing BM25-vs-dense on the fresh meta

#### Scenario: The printed remediation is honest

- **GIVEN** the watcher deferred a vector update and told the user to run `openlore analyze --force`
- **WHEN** the user (or the watcher's own background rebuild) completes that rebuild
- **THEN** the live server serves the rebuilt index without a process restart

### Requirement: IncrementalIndexUpdateNeverDropsRowsSilently

The incremental vector-index update SHALL NOT leave the index missing the changed files' rows when
its add step fails after the delete step: the update SHALL either stage-then-swap or restore the
deleted rows on add failure. If the index cannot be restored, the system SHALL record a degraded
marker and disclose "index degraded — re-run analyze" through the search tools' output — a
stderr-only log line SHALL NOT be the sole signal. A transient local-embedding extractor failure
SHALL NOT be memoized: a failed extractor load is retried on the next embed call rather than
replayed for the lifetime of the service instance.

#### Scenario: Add failure restores the deleted rows

- **GIVEN** an incremental update whose delete committed and whose add then fails
- **WHEN** the failure is handled
- **THEN** the previously-read rows are restored (or the delete never committed), and the changed
  functions remain findable via search

#### Scenario: Unrestorable failure is disclosed, not debug-logged

- **GIVEN** both the add and the restore fail
- **WHEN** the next search runs against that index
- **THEN** the result carries an "index degraded — re-run analyze" disclosure

#### Scenario: Extractor failure is retried, not replayed

- **GIVEN** a local embedding service whose first extractor load threw transiently
- **WHEN** a later embed call runs on the same instance
- **THEN** the extractor load is attempted again instead of rethrowing the memoized rejection
