# Tasks — add-memory-anchor-verdicts

## Implementation
- [ ] `types/index.ts`: additive span fields on `StructuralAnchor` (span text baseline hash +
      recorded offsets); old anchors keep exact current behavior
- [ ] `anchor-adapter.ts`: `resolveInputAnchors` (:241-246) accepts an optional `span` hint —
      exact-text located within the resolved symbol's body (`nodeSpanText`, one slicing source);
      unlocatable/ambiguous at record time → recorded symbol-level with disclosure
- [ ] `anchor.ts`: span verdict in `anchorFreshness` — unique exact-text match ⇒ fresh
      (relocated ok); none ⇒ drifted; multiple ⇒ orphaned + candidate locations (the
      possiblyMovedTo discipline, types/index.ts:706-714); aggregate rule (:205-215) unchanged
- [ ] `continuity-carry-forward.ts`: after a symbol carry, re-locate the span in the new body by
      the same exact-text rule; ambiguous ⇒ needs-human-reselection, never a guess
- [ ] `memory.ts`: additive `outcome` on `summarizeVerdict` (:567-593) — silently-carried /
      re-pointed-with-provenance / needs-human-reselection — mapped from existing states; no
      change to authoritative filtering (:382)
- [ ] `enforcement-policy.ts:81`: register `memory-anchor-lost` (advisory default, source
      `memory-freshness`, GovernanceFinding shape); emit one finding per
      needs-human-reselection memory; surface through `openlore enforce`
- [ ] `mcp.ts:2003-2012`: remember schema gains optional `span` (memory preset + full only)

## Verification
- [ ] Span survives an unrelated edit in the same function (memory stays fresh) — the false-drift
      case whole-symbol anchoring fails today
- [ ] Span edited ⇒ drifted; span duplicated in the body ⇒ orphaned with candidates, never
      re-attached; symbol renamed + span intact ⇒ re-pointed-with-provenance
- [ ] Multi-state gap (symbol renamed while unindexed, no continuity pair) ⇒
      needs-human-reselection with the adjacency-limit reason disclosed
- [ ] `openlore enforce` lists `memory-anchor-lost` findings; advisory by default; blocking only
      via `enforcement.policy`; enforcement-policy.test.ts covers the new code
- [ ] Old stores load unchanged (no span ⇒ byte-identical verdict behavior)
- [ ] tools/list full ceiling re-measured (88,000 B, mcp-presets.test.ts:581); substrate default
      prefix byte-identical; full suite green

## Spec
- [ ] `mcp-handlers` delta: ADD SubSymbolSpanAnchors, AnchorLossIsAnActionableWorkItem
