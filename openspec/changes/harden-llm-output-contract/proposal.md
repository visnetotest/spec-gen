# Harden the LLM output contract: shape-check what you parse, disclose what you drop

> Status: PROPOSED (2026-07-03, e2e audit pass 3). Three verified defects on the consuming
> side of the opt-in LLM layer: the decisions pipeline parses raw completions with a
> shape-blind `parseJSON` and then dereferences fields that may not exist (a TypeError from
> a weaker model kills the whole run), a truncated response silently becomes an empty
> result (real decisions lost with only a misleading "returned 0 decisions" warning), and
> the verifier presents an LLM's self-reported accuracy score as if it were the
> deterministic metric. Schema-guard the parses, turn truncation into disclosure, and label
> LLM-judged scores with their provenance.

## The gap

- **(a) Shape-blind parsing crashes the run.** `parseJSON` (`misc.ts:10-19`) validates only
  that text parses — any shape, or the fallback. The decisions path uses raw
  `llm.complete()` + `parseJSON`, not the schema-checked `completeJSON`: the extractor
  dereferences `e.affectedFiles.length` (`extractor.ts:177`) and the consolidator passes
  `c.affectedFiles` into `resolveDomainsFromFiles` (`consolidator.ts:164`) with no shape
  guard. A syntactically-valid but field-incomplete response — plausible from weaker local
  models — throws a TypeError that kills the whole consolidation run. (Distinct from
  `harden-decision-consolidation`, which covers the spawn/CAS/status lifecycle, not
  response-shape parsing — verified no overlap.)
- **(b) Truncation silently swallowed.** Extractor and consolidator cap output at
  `DECISIONS_CONSOLIDATION_MAX_TOKENS = 2_000` (`constants.ts:617`; `extractor.ts:160`,
  `consolidator.ts:147`). A response truncated mid-array fails `parseJSON`'s regex and
  returns the `[]` fallback — real decisions silently lost. The only signal is the
  consolidator's misleading "returned 0 decisions" warning (`consolidator.ts:154-156`),
  which reads as "the LLM found nothing", not "the response was cut off". (The companion
  change `harden-llm-request-lifecycle` makes `finishReason` available/warned at the
  service; THIS change makes the parsers refuse to silently drop.)
- **(c) An LLM opinion presented as the metric.** The verifier consumes the LLM's
  self-reported `specAccuracyScore` directly as the spec-accuracy similarity
  (`verification-engine.ts:590-598`; prompt at `:522-531`) — an LLM-as-judge number
  presented undifferentiated from the deterministic checks around it. (Verified NOT covered
  by `fix-cli-conclusion-honesty` — that proposal has no verifier/accuracy mention.)

## What changes

1. **Schema-validated decision parsing.** The extractor and consolidator move to the
   `completeJSON` path or equivalent per-element shape guards: each element is checked for
   the fields the code dereferences (`title`, `rationale`, `affectedFiles` as an array, …);
   a malformed element is skipped WITH disclosure ("skipped N malformed decision entries"),
   never a TypeError, never a silent drop of the valid rest.
2. **Truncation is an error with a remedy, not an empty result.** When the response's
   `finishReason === 'length'` (or the parse fails on a response at the token cap), the
   pipeline reports "response truncated at N tokens — decisions may be lost; raise the cap
   or reduce scope" instead of returning `[]`; the misleading "returned 0 decisions"
   warning is reserved for genuinely-empty valid responses.
3. **LLM-judged scores carry provenance.** The verifier labels `specAccuracyScore` as
   LLM-judged (with the model id) in report output, keeps the deterministic sub-checks
   (import/export/requirement coverage) separately attributed, and never blends the two
   into one undifferentiated number; when no LLM score is available the existing keyword
   fallback is labeled as such.

## Why this is in scope

Doctrine says conclusions carry receipts and degradation is disclosed. Today the decisions
pipeline can lose recorded architectural intent to a truncated response and call it "0
decisions", and the verifier presents model opinion as measurement — both silent-degradation
defects in existing opt-in features. All fixes are deterministic guards around the LLM
boundary; no LLM is added anywhere, and the hot path is untouched.

## Impact

- Files: `src/core/decisions/extractor.ts`, `src/core/decisions/consolidator.ts` (schema
  guards + truncation disclosure), `src/utils/misc.ts` (unchanged or gains an optional
  validated variant), `src/core/verifier/verification-engine.ts` + report rendering
  (provenance labels); tests for malformed-element skip, truncation disclosure, and score
  labeling.
- Specs: `llm` — 2 ADDED requirements (StructuredOutputShapeValidation,
  TruncatedOutputIsDisclosedNotEmpty); `verifier` — 1 ADDED requirement
  (LlmJudgedScoresCarryProvenance).
- Tool surface: unchanged (no new tool; decisions/verifier are CLI+gate paths, no MCP
  payload-budget impact).
- Risk: low. Runs that previously crashed or silently emptied now degrade with disclosure;
  verifier report output gains provenance fields (additive); no behavior change when
  responses are well-formed.
