# Enforcement baseline ratchet: a `frozen` class that blocks only NEW findings

> Status: PROPOSED (2026-07-03, e2e audit follow-up). A fourth categorical enforcement class,
> `frozen`: first run records existing violations into a plain-text, VCS-committable baseline;
> subsequent runs block only findings NOT in the baseline; a finding that disappears is
> auto-removed (the ratchet — fixed debt can't sneak back). Prior art: ArchUnit's
> FreezingArchRule (https://www.archunit.org/userguide/html/000_Index.html), the mechanism that
> made architecture rules adoptable on brownfield codebases. No new tuning constants — the class
> is categorical.

## The gap

`enforcement.policy` maps a finding code to exactly `blocking | advisory | off`
(`src/types/index.ts:97`; `ENFORCEMENT_CLASSES`,
`src/core/services/mcp-handlers/enforcement-policy.ts:35`), resolved per finding by
`resolveEnforcementClass` (`enforcement-policy.ts:186`) over the registered codes in
`FINDING_CODE_REGISTRY` (`enforcement-policy.ts:81`). The `openlore enforce` gate blocks when at
least one finding resolves to `blocking` (`src/cli/commands/enforce.ts:9`) — which on a
brownfield repo with hundreds of pre-existing findings means flipping a code to `blocking` blocks
the very next commit on ALL of them at once. So the practical steady state is the one the CLI
itself installs: "advisory (never blocks) until enforcement.policy … maps a finding code to
'blocking'" (`enforce.ts:97`) — everything stays advisory, and drift accumulates through a gate
that exists but cannot be turned on. Sibling `widen-architecture-rule-vocabulary` makes this
acute: its new rule findings (`architecture-cycle`, `architecture-orphan`, …) will fire in bulk
on day one of any real repo — exactly the findings that need a freeze-then-ratchet path to be
adoptable at all.

## What changes

- **A fourth enforcement class, `frozen`** — added to the `EnforcementClass` union,
  `ENFORCEMENT_CLASSES`, and the `resolveEnforcementClass` ladder. Categorical, like the other
  three: no threshold, no constant.
- **Baseline store, plain text, committed.** On the first run with a code mapped `frozen`,
  existing findings for that code are recorded in a human-readable file under `.openlore/` (one
  line per finding identity), intended for version control so a reviewer sees exactly which debt
  was frozen, as a diff. A baseline is written only under an explicit `frozen` policy — never
  silently.
- **Finding identity = `code` + `subject` (+ a stable discriminator** where one code can fire
  more than once per subject). The unified `GovernanceFinding` shape already carries stable
  `code` and `subject` fields (`enforcement-policy.ts:47-57` —
  `{ code, severity, source, subject, message }`); identity deliberately excludes `message` and
  any file:line, so baseline matching is **line-number-insensitive by construction** — moving a
  frozen violation within its file does not un-freeze it.
- **Gate semantics.** A `frozen`-classed finding present in the baseline reports as frozen
  (advisory, labeled); one absent from the baseline blocks like `blocking`. Output always
  discloses the ratchet state: "312 frozen, 2 new → blocked on the 2."
- **The ratchet.** A baseline entry whose finding no longer fires is auto-removed on the next
  run — regressions cannot sneak back behind the freeze. Baseline shrinkage shows up as committed
  diffs (visible progress).
- **Surfaces.** `openlore enforce` (`src/cli/commands/enforce.ts`, including `--hook` mode) and
  the review pipeline (`src/cli/commands/review.ts` + the bundled
  `.github/actions/openlore-review/action.yml`) gain frozen semantics. A policy downgrade
  (`frozen` → `advisory`) leaves the baseline file in place but stops blocking; re-upgrading
  resumes against the ratcheted baseline.

Deliberately NOT borrowed from ArchUnit: freezing by violation-message text (fragile — identity
here is the structural `code`+`subject`, so a reworded message or moved line never un-freezes),
its per-rule ViolationStore plumbing and JVM configuration surface, and any
`allowStoreUpdate`-style mutable-store toggle — the only writes are the explicit first freeze and
the automatic ratchet removal, both visible as VCS diffs.

## Why this is in scope

The enforcement machinery is built (registry, resolver, gate, review action) and doctrinally
advisory-by-default; what is missing is the adoption path from advisory to blocking on a repo
with history. `frozen` is that path — a categorical class in the existing resolver, a plain-text
file, zero constants — and it is what lets the sibling's new architecture findings, and every
already-registered code, actually gate on brownfield repos.

## Impact

- Files: `src/types/index.ts` (union), `mcp-handlers/enforcement-policy.ts` (class, resolver,
  baseline match), a small baseline read/write module beside it, `src/cli/commands/enforce.ts`
  (gate semantics + disclosure), `src/cli/commands/review.ts` / review action (frozen rendering).
- Specs: `mcp-handlers` — 1 ADDED requirement (EnforcementBaselineRatchet) — matching the
  sibling's enforcement-delta domain.
- Tool surface: unchanged (no new tool; no payload-budget impact).
- Risk: baseline merge conflicts on busy repos (mitigated: one finding per line, sorted stable —
  conflicts are line-local and legible); identity collisions where one code fires repeatedly on
  one subject (mitigated: the stable discriminator, spelled out per source).
