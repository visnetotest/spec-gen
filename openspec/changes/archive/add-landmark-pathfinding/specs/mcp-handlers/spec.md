## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: GoalConditionedLandmarkPathfinding

The system SHALL provide a `find_path` tool that accepts `from` and `to` endpoints expressed as exact
names or as selectors (`landmark:<id>`, `role:entrypoint|hub|sink`, `file:<path>`), resolves them to
concrete functions, and returns the single cheapest call path between them with a bounded set of
alternates and a stated reason. Path cost SHALL use call-distance when available and hop-count
otherwise.

Each `role` selector SHALL resolve through an existing deterministic classifier and SHALL NOT
introduce a new threshold: `entrypoint` = the graph's entry points; `hub` = the existing critical-hub
set; `sink` = a call-graph leaf that is actually called, defined as **zero outgoing internal call
edges AND fan-in ≥ 1** (parameter-free — no "high fan-in" or "leaf-ish" cutoff).

#### Scenario: Role-based endpoints resolve and route

- **GIVEN** a request for `from = role:entrypoint`, `to = file:src/db/writer.ts`
- **WHEN** `find_path` is invoked
- **THEN** each endpoint resolves to concrete functions and the response returns the cheapest path
  from a resolved entry point to a function in that file, with `resolvedFrom`/`resolvedTo` shown

#### Scenario: Sink selector is parameter-free

- **GIVEN** a function with zero outgoing internal call edges and at least one caller, and another
  leaf function with no callers
- **WHEN** `to = role:sink` is resolved
- **THEN** the first function resolves as a sink and the uncalled leaf does not, using only the
  existing leaf classifier and fan-in ≥ 1 — with no tunable threshold

#### Scenario: Cheapest path reflects edge cost

- **GIVEN** a short weakly-resolved path and a longer strongly-resolved path between two endpoints
- **WHEN** `find_path` runs with call-distance enabled
- **THEN** it selects the strongly-resolved path and reports its distance and hops; with call-distance
  disabled it selects the fewest-hops path

#### Scenario: No path is an explicit answer

- **GIVEN** two endpoints with no call path within the depth/distance budget
- **WHEN** `find_path` is invoked
- **THEN** it returns a structured "no path within budget" result stating how far the search reached,
  not an empty list

#### Scenario: Response is conclusion-shaped

- **GIVEN** any successful `find_path` invocation
- **WHEN** the response is produced
- **THEN** it contains the chosen path chain plus at most a bounded number of alternates, and no
  unbounded node-and-edge dump
