# Tasks — add-benchmark-harness-protocol

## Implementation
- [ ] `bench/` harness: generalize the ADR-0023 scripts (`scripts/bench-preset-surface.ts`,
      `bench-preset-selection.ts`, `bench-preset-completion.ts`) from navigation-vs-substrate to
      arbitrary preset-A-vs-preset-B comparison; reuse `bench-agent.ts` (corpus, oracle,
      `--strict-mcp-config` isolation) and `src/bench/transcript-metrics.ts` unchanged
- [ ] Distractor-aware corpus format: each task declares expected tool(s) + required plausible
      distractors present in the surface under test; corpus validation fails loudly on a task
      naming a tool id that no longer exists
- [ ] Deterministic post-hoc trajectory metrics from logged runs: tool-selection accuracy, step
      count, token cost per task under a fixed agent config; NO LLM-as-judge anywhere in scoring
- [ ] Containerized task pinning: a pinned image per corpus alongside the existing repo-SHA
      pinning; runs record image digest + SHA + agent config in the results artifact
- [ ] `bench/PROTOCOL.md`: pre-registered decision rule (fixed before any run), both repo tiers,
      both models, results artifact checked in with the change, ADR cites the run; the
      DefaultSurfaceRevealsAllFaces run documented as the first conforming instance
- [ ] Keep bench out of per-commit CI (manual/scheduled only); deterministic sub-benchmarks
      (surface arithmetic) remain runnable at $0 via `--dry-run`

## Verification
- [ ] Dry-run of the generalized harness over `navigation` vs `substrate` reproduces the ADR-0023
      deterministic quantities (token economy, face coverage) from `bench-preset-surface.ts`
- [ ] Corpus validation: a task with a stale tool id fails validation; a distractor absent from
      the surface under test is reported, not silently skipped
- [ ] Metric determinism: the same logged transcript scores identically across runs and machines
- [ ] Protocol completeness check: `PROTOCOL.md` names decision-rule pre-registration, tiers,
      models, artifact check-in, and the ADR citation step
- [ ] `npm run test:run` unaffected (no per-commit bench); full suite green

## Spec
- [ ] `mcp-quality` delta: ADD DefaultSurfaceDecisionsRideTheBenchmarkProtocol
- [ ] `project` delta: ADD BenchmarkHarnessIsReproducibleAndDeterministicallyScored

## Coordination
- [ ] `reconcile-substrate-write-face` (unmodified here): its benchmark-gated flip evaluation is
      the first intended client of the protocol once this ships
